<p>After over a month of work and 243 commits, <a href="https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/pull/844">Open Live Writer now has the ability to publish to static site blogs</a>. And as such, I have decided to move my blog to a static Jekyll site, built and hosted on GitHub Pages. Open Live Writer works brilliantly with this setup, and in fact it’s how I’m authoring this post right now. </p>

It saw a short burst of community activity initially, but not really much since then. Whilst contributions have tapered off, the “fan-base” certainly has not – Open Live Writer still sees a lot of usage in the blogging community to this day. I’m hoping that the static site support brings a new momentum into the project, encouraging other developers to get their hands dirty and add their own features and fixes. This project has a truly fascinating story, and for me at-least, is an absolute joy to work on.</p>
