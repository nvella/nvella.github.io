<p>So I’ve decided to start blogging again. You should be able to expect a myriad of topics from me, mainly with a focus on software development and my love for public transport.</p><p>In terms of the tools I’ve decided to equip myself with; the blog itself is hosted on Blogger, and I’m authoring the posts with Open Live Writer, giving the whole experience for me a very late-2000s feel. I’m not sure for how long I’ll be able to put up with this for.</p><p>Until next time…</p>
