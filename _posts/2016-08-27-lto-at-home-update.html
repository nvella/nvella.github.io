So it's been a long while since I've mentioned my LTO tape set-up because it's been a long while since I've actually attempted to use it. Long story short, two of the four second-hand tapes I purchased ended up failing, and even with the working tapes I acquired I could never reliably read back data I wrote, which I believe is probably due to a faulty drive.<br><br>One caveat with using old second-hand LTO equipment is that there is a decent chance that it'll be faulty in some way, so keep that in mind if you want to mess with LTO. I'll probably attempt to use the tapes again in the future, but for now they sit on my shelf, collecting dust.
